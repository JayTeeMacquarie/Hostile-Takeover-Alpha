# Hostile Takeover
Hostile Takeover is a dark 2D side scrolling platformer where you play as a parasite trying to grow and mutate by inhabiting NPCâ€™s as hosts, draining their life and controlling their bodies for your own gain. Escape your enclosure and travel deeper and deeper to get out of the underground complex, fighting your way through a labyrinth of labs and holding cells, possessing a wide variety of increasingly tougher entities-each with their own unique abilities in order to find the perfect host.
